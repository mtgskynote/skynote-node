CUREENT TODO

	"All Lessons" Page
		Style to match rest of app
		Default to "expanded" level view (now you have to click to expand levels)


	OVERVIEW software documentation 

	Add your own XML score
		Design - probably show on the "All Lessons" page
			Should be private (so need to add to student DB schema)

	Music "Quality" visualizaitons on score (like the iOS version)

	Get Timbre Visualization signal processing working the right way

	Test Essentia.js signal processing for pitch tracking, musical qualities - compare with current Crepe/Meyda libraries for speed & ease-of-use.

	Platform test: PC, Mac, Android tablets, iOs tablets, Android Phone, iPhone, (screen-size look&feel, functionality, speed/responsiveness)
	Browser test: Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Safari (display, audio functionality)

	Login through Google and Facebook accounts (? People are used to this, but it seems to have negative security and ethical implications)

	Session/Practice time timer and tracking on Dashboard


MEDIUM TERM

	Teacher view design -> then teacher DB schema

	Other (monophonic) instruments
		Design interface - maybe select on Profile page, store instrument globally so that all pages are as they are now, but for correct instrument
		Priorities:
			Voice, cello, viola, 


LONG TERM TODO

	Score following (cursor position on music score follows user as the play)

	User-generated exercises to address specific needs.
		examples
			exercise for trills on the 'A' string
			scale exercises for different keys

		Design 
			Doesn't need to be private like uploaded scores, so uers can share if they want.



	Polyphonic Instruments
		Oi.
